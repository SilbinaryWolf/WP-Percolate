<p>Installing the Percolate Plugin for WordPress is easy, even if you haven 't done it before. WordPress plugins are fantastic because they allow you to add additional functionality and features which are not standard to a basic WordPress installation. If you are new to WordPress or Plugins, WordPress has some great background info on how to work with them on the site WordPress on Plugins.   </p>

<p>The steps to adding the Percolate plugin are:</p>

<ol>
<li>Download the plugin</li>
<li>Add New plugin</li>
<li>Upload and Activate</li>
<li>Complete Percolate Settings</li>
</ol><h2>
<a name="1-download-the-plugin" class="anchor" href="#1-download-the-plugin"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>1. Download the Plugin</h2>

<p>The latest plugin can always be downloaded here. Save it to your computer, but don 't unzip it: <a href="https://github.com/percolate/WP-Percolate/archive/master.zip">https://github.com/percolate/WP-Percolate/archive/master.zip</a>   </p>

<h2>
<a name="2-add-new-plugin" class="anchor" href="#2-add-new-plugin"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>2. Add New Plugin</h2>

<ul>
<li>Percolate User Type - There are two user types the plugin is designed for; Single Percolate Users and Multiple Percolate Users. If there is more than one Percolate user, use the Multiple Users option. Percolate will provide this info.</li>
<li>Percolate API Key - The API Key authenticates your account and allows Wordpress to communicate with Percolate via the API. Percolate will provide this info.
Website - This specifies which Percolate dot com posts will be imported. There will typically be only one option, select it.</li>
<li>Publish Status - This setting dictates whether Percolate posts will be imported as draft or live posts. We always recommend that posts be imported as drafts so they can be previewed and finalized before publishing to your Wordpress theme.</li>
<li>Default License Author - When a Wordpress author does not exist for a Percolate license author, posts from Percolate will be assigned from this Wordpress user. (i.e. if a new Percolate user creates a post but has not been mapped to a WP user)</li>
<li>License Authors - Allows you to map the Percolate license author with the Wordpress Author. There can be a unique Wordpress author for every Percolate license author publishing to WP. Click ''refresh'' to update WP with any new Percolate users that need to be mapped to a WP author. Otherwise the default in the step above will be used.</li>
<li>Category - This setting will assign a WordPress Category to all of the posts from Percolate (ex: "blog"). This can dictate where posts from Percolate will appear.
Post Type - This setting allows you to specify what WordPress post type content from Percolate will be imported as. In most cases the default type ''post'' should be used.</li>
<li>Save - click 'Save Changes ' to ensure settings are updated.
Support If you have any questions or troubles, please feel free to reach out to your Percolate client solutions manager anytime. They are more than happy to help you through the install process.</li>
